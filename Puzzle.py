# Apply Graph traversal to solve a problem (Portfolio Project Problem):
# You are given a 2-D puzzle of size MxN, that has N rows and M column (M and N can be
# different). Each cell in the puzzle is either empty or has a barrier. An empty cell is marked by
# ‘-’ (hyphen) and the one with a barrier is marked by ‘#’.
#
# You are given two coordinates from the puzzle (a,b) and (x,y).
# You are currently located at (a,b) and want to reach (x,y).

# You can move only in the following directions.
# L: move to left cell from the current cell
# R: move to right cell from the current cell
# U: move to upper cell from the current cell
# D: move to the lower cell from the current cell

# You can move to only an empty cell and cannot move to a cell with a barrier in it. Your goal
# is to reach the destination cells covering the minimum number of cells as you travel from the
# starting cell.

# Input: puzzle, source, destination.
# Puzzle: A list of lists, each list represents a row in the rectangular puzzle. Each
# element is either ‘-’ for empty (passable) or ‘#’ for obstacle (impassable). The same
# as in the example.
# Puzzle = [
#  ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
#  ['-', '-', '#', '-', '-'],
#  ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
#  ['#', '-', '#', '#', '-'],
#  ['-', '#', '-', '-', '-']
# ]

# source: A tuple representing the indices of the starting position, e.g. for the upper right corner, source=(0, 4).

# destination: A tuple representing the indices of the goal position, e.g. for the lower right corner, goal=(4, 4).

# Output: A list of tuples representing the indices of each position in the path. The first tuple
# should be the starting position, or source, and the last tuple should be the destination. If
# there is no valid path, None should be returned. Not an empty list, but the None object. If
# source and destination are same return the same cell.


# we will use a deque to access first and last cells
