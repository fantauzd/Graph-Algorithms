# Implement Primsâ€™ algorithm Name your function Prims(G). Include function in the file
# MST.PY. You can either use brute force approach or priority queue. Try to see if you can
# come up with a solution using priority queue.
# Input: a graph represented as an adjacency matrix
# For example, the graph in the Exploration would be represented as the below
# (where index 0 is A, index 1 is B, etc.).
# input = [
# [0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
# [8, 0, 10, 2, 18, 0, 0],
# [5, 10, 0, 3, 0, 16, 0],
# [0, 2, 3, 0, 12, 30, 14],
# [0, 18, 0, 12, 0, 0, 4],
# [0, 0, 16, 30, 0, 0, 26],
# [0, 0, 0, 14, 4, 26, 0]
# ]
# Output: a list of tuples, wherein each tuple represents an edge of the MST as (v1, v2,
# weight)
# For example, the MST of the graph in the Exploration would be represented as the
# below.
# output = [(0, 2, 5), (2, 3, 3), (3, 1, 2), (3, 4, 12), (2, 5, 16), (4, 6, 4)]
# Note: the order of edge tuples within the output does not matter; additionally, the
# order of vertices within each edge does not matter.
